Practice meshing, etc..

2/15/2021
cleaned up stuff

created practice_2_15_2021 folder which mimics "example2" from Sierra SD training docs, except with our models
- still need to change the input files to accomodate the new models
- this is currently a working directory
- I kept r0 around because we had worked thru that one most recently on our 1/4/2021 practice run, probably delete later
