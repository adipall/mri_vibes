Cojocaru elliptic cylinder function toolbox
revised for readability, modularity, duplication,
mid-frequency acoustics in elliptic cylinders
challenging tests, not ellipsoidal 
E. Cojocaru  Spm = angular Mathieu function = Mathieu function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    E. Cojocaru, revised November 2008
    Observations, suggestions, and recommendations are welcome at e-mail:
    ecojocaru@theory.nipne.ro
Changes performed by revision, November 2008:
-notations 'eta' and 'veta' are replaced by 't' and 'vt', respectively;
-notation of expansion coefficients Boe and Boo is changed to
 Aoe and Aoo, respectively;
-the option "nobalance" is added in the routine 'eig_Spm';
-the minus sign is taken off at odd radial functions:
Joe, Joo, Yoe, and Yoo; also at their derivatives;
-the minus sign is added in Eq.(27) of the revised documentation;
-the routines 'extract_one_value' and 'extract_one_column' are added;
-tables II-VI providing numerical values are added;
-a more clear distinction is done between the radial Mathieu function
 of the first kind, Jpm(u,q,n) and 
 the 'modified' Mathieu function, Spm(iu,q,n).

 I aknowledge the suggestions and the kind help accorded by Prof. D. A.
 Pujara, Nirma University, India.
